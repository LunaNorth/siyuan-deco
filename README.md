# Light Decor Notes 

Add beautiful card styles to SiYuan blocks via custom attributes. Supports icons, titles, and multiple preset styles to make your notes visually consistent and more aesthetically pleasing.

## Features

- **Attribute-driven styling**: Set attributes like `custom-style`, `data-card-icon`, `data-card-title` to automatically apply corresponding card appearances.
- **Multiple preset card groups**: Includes creative cards, split-color cards, quote cards, colored bars, and more to meet various needs.
- **Click to edit**: Quickly modify the style, icon, or title by clicking on the card header area.
- **Right-click menu integration**: Switch to any card style with one click from the context menu of a selected block.
- **Persistent styling**: All settings are automatically saved to block attributes and remain effective after restart or sync.
- **Lightweight & non‑intrusive**: No modification of original content; only controls the presentation layer via attributes – safe and reliable.

## Usage

1. Install and enable this plugin.
2. Select any block, right‑click → **Card View** → choose a card type (e.g., “Inspiration Card”, “Split‑Color Card”).
3. The block will automatically apply the selected style, displaying an icon and title bar.
4. (Optional) Click on the top area of the card to open the edit window and customize the icon or title text.
5. All settings are saved automatically and will persist after refreshing or reopening the document.

> 💡 Note: Quote‑style cards (e.g., “Quote Card”) are not editable by default to maintain semantic consistency.
